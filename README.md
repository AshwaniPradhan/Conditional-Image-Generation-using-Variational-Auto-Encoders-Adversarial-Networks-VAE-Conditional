# Conditional-Image-Generation-using-Variational-Auto-Encoders-Adversarial-Networks-VAE-Conditional
We present a type of hybrid generative model that combines the strength of both Variational Auto-Encoders(VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) to generate an image for the label provided by the user.
